As with any other language, loops are very convenient. With Bash you can use for
loops, while loops, and until loops.
50For loops
Here is the structure of a for loop:
for var in ${list}
do
your_commands
done
Example:
#!/bin/bash
users="devdojo bobby tony"
for user in ${users}
do
echo "${user}"
done
A quick rundown of the example:
First, we specify a list of users and store the value in a variable called $users.
After that, we start our for loop with the for keyword.
Then we define a new variable which would represent each item from the list
that we give. In our case, we define a variable called user, which would
represent each user from the $users variable.
Then we specify the in keyword followed by our list that we will loop through.
On the next line, we use the do keyword, which indicates what we will do for
each iteration of the loop.
Then we specify the commands that we want to run.
Finally, we close the loop with the done keyword.
