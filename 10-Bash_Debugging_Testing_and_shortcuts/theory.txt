In order to debug your bash scripts, you can use -x when executing your scripts:
bash -x ./your_script.sh
Or you can add set -x before the specific line that you want to debug, set -x
enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal.
Another way to test your scripts is to use this fantastic tool here:
